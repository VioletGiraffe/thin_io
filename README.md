# Thin IO
A lightweight cross-platform low-level C++ file library based directly on the native system API. Not using `<stdio>` or `<fstream>`.

With this library you can create, write, read, and delete files. No extra bloat, no built-in support for serializing high-level types, just binary I/O.

The interface is self-explanatory: https://github.com/VioletGiraffe/thin_io/blob/master/src/file_interface.hpp

Clone this with
`git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules`
